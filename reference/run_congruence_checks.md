# Run all congruence checks

Run all congruence checks

## Usage

``` r
run_congruence_checks(
  directory = here::here(),
  metadata = load_metadata(directory),
  check_metadata_only = FALSE,
  skip_cols = NA,
  output_filename,
  output_dir = here::here()
)
```

## Arguments

- directory:

  the directory where the data file(s) are found (i.e. your data
  package). Defaults to the current working directory. On exit, returns
  to the current working directory.

- metadata:

  The metadata object returned by `load_metadata`. If parameter not
  provided, defaults to calling `load_metadata` in current project
  directory.

- check_metadata_only:

  Only run checks on the metadata and skip anything involving data
  files.

- skip_cols:

  String. Defaults to NA. A list of one or more columns in the data to
  skip when testing whether the dates within data fall within the dates
  range specified in metadata. Useful if, for instance, there are
  columns within the data associated with the QA/QC process and these
  dates are expected to fall outside the date range specified for the
  data.

- output_filename:

  Optional. If specified, saves results of congruence checks to this
  file. If omitted, prints results to console. If the file already
  exists, results will be appended to the existing file.

- output_dir:

  Location in which to save the output file, if using.

## Value

Invisibly returns `metadata`.
